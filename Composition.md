# Composition
The composition is a special case of **aggregation**. The composition is a more restrictive form of aggregation. When the contained object in “HAS-A” relationship can’t exist on its own, then it’s a case of composition. 

Example: House has-a Room. Here the room can’t exist without the house. 

Composition is said to be better than inheritance.
