### Association
Association is the OOPS concept to define the relationship between objects. The association defines the multiplicity between objects. For example Teacher and Student objects. There is a one-to-many relationship between a teacher and students. Similarly, a student can have a one-to-many relationship with teacher objects. However, both student and teacher objects are independent of each other.
