# Introduction
**Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)** is a programming paradigm which uses [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)) and [classes](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp). The following are the core concepts behind OOPs.
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance
5. Association
6. Composition
7. Aggregation


These are called builtin types and function differently from other objects.
